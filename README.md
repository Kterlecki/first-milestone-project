#The Monkees!

 

In this project I focused on trying to create a modern website for the Monkees band while keeping a 60s vibe. I felt that this is particularly important as the demographic for this band is older. I also hope this choice would remind the older demographic of their youth and potentially lead to some fond memories coming back.

 

 

For this reason I tried to be as simplistic as possible as the user base for this website is of an older age and might not necessarily be proficient with the use of technology.

However I believe the youth will also appreciate the theme of this website as it is quite common to see people being fascinated with 20th century themes.

#UX

 

This website is primarily aimed at The Monkees fans and anyone interested in listening and catching up with some classic bands. Since the primary demographic will be of an older age the website uses simple navigation with clear distinctive pages. Each page provides the necessary information and/or inter activeness to try and making it enjoyable to go through each page. The navigation is done by using a responsive navigation menu which moves from a Mobile to a Desktop version.

 

This website also is intended to make sure a user can see that a new album is going to be released and that bookings and tours are available with easily accessible  buy options. The layout/word-choice/music choice are all done with an intent to cause excitement about the band which will lead to tickets/albums sold.

 

The site used HTML5 and CSS3 to a level reached in module 1-3 of this course.

 

The UI colors that were chosen for this project are black, white and yellow. This decision was made  to keep within the theme of 60s bands. Also as the demographic is older I wanted to leave very little distractions on the screen and keep the colour contrasts simple.

 

 



 

#Features

 

##The monkees (homepage) 

The homepage emphasises that the band is back to try to encourage interest of its users. This is intended to make the users navigate through the website.

 

##Tour

This provides a description of the upcoming tours with dates etc. Also a ‘buy tickets’ button is present which lead to the bookings page.

 

##Albums

This page shows off the different albums that the band has realised and emphasis the new album coming out.  The page also has some icons to emphasise songs.

 

##Songs

This page shows off some of the songs made by the band which play when clicked. It also includes an MP4 file show casing one of the bands songs.

 

##Contact 

This page gives a booking option for the band. Created by boot strap 4

 

##Other Features



Social links- social links are present in the footer which would allow a user to access different social media accounts. At the moment the don’t link to anything

 

Booking option present which takes into account your details but its not linked into anything



Booking option required all fields to be filled in before its accepted 

 

Video and songs embedded in the ‘top song’ page

 

 

##Plans for improvement

 I would like to include a better version of payments. Currently there is a form which takes your details for bookings but no way of actually buying tickets.

Would also like to include a sign in option with a chat page which would allow the community to have a group discussion about the band.

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
-HTML 5 was used as it uses semantic markups to effectively design webages.
 

- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)

- was used for styling and layout options of the HTML pages.

 

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/) 

-was used to style and help with certain aspects of the layout of the HTML page

 

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com) 

-this was used for bootstrap navbar and animation

 

 

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 

-has been used to style the font used. They provide a wide range of accessible fonts that can be used.

 

 

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) 
-was used to add in sharp looking icons. Font awesome provide a wide range of icons that are free of charge and can be used for a variety of scenarioes
 - [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_text.asp/)

-was used to optimise both CSS and HTML code. Helped me to adjust and insert different features.

#Testing

Testing was carried out on each navigation button on each site to ensure the links are working correctly. Other testing that was performed was the responsiveness of the website on mobile, tablet and desktop. Both portrait and landscape was tested.

 

googole developer tools was used to test the website on all different screen resolutions available and switching from landscape to portrait modes.

 

The code was also tested on html and css validator

 

The entire website was tested on responsinator just in case anything was missed on googole developer tools

 

Was also tested on real life devices like :

-Samsung S8 and S5

-Iphone X

 

 

 ##Responsive testing

 

Depending on the screen resolution each page might look different. For example the ‘Songs’ and ‘Album’ webpage changes layout from mobile to desktop to enchance the user experience. This is also true of the  navigation bar which switches to a dropdown at a lower resolutions for mobile devices. On desktop the navigation bar shows links to each page. While other pages like ‘the monkees’, ‘tour’ and’booking’  don’t have layout changes in lower resolutions for their main content.



 

Deployment

 

I decided to use github to host my webpage. I found a guide on how to do this on the following page:


- [Github Pages Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)

One of the main reasons why I decided to use github is that we have used it through the course and I feel relatively familiar with it. It also helps that its free. It also extremely easy to use as it can host your webpage aslong as your code is present. This required no extra configurations.

##Acknowledgements 

I looked at band like:

- [gunsnrosess ](https://www.gunsnroses.com/) 
- [ACDC](https://www.acdc.com/) 
- [RollingStones]( https://www.rollingstones.com/) 

These gave me an idea of what market leaders are currently doing on their websites.
